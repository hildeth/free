// Example code for experiments involving several traits, each of which can be supported
// or refuted by tests associated with each trait.  Positive and negative tests are
// symmetrical: there is a positive and negative test for each trait.  If positive and
// negative tests for the trait fail, then there is no evidence for that trait; if
// positive and negative tests both succeed, then evidence for that trait is conflicting.
//
// An experiment consists of a number of trials.  The results of an experiment can be
// summarized, results from several experiments can be compared and combined, etc.
